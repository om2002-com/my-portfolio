<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Om – a passionate storyteller and tech enthusiast who finds joy both in dissecting films and in building seamless digital experiences.
By heart, I’m a movie buff. I grew up immersed in the world of cinema – from Bollywood classics to the latest South Indian blockbusters, from Hollywood thrillers 
to hidden indie gems. I love analyzing not just what makes a movie entertaining, but also how it connects with the audience emotionally. Whether it’s the cinematography, background score, character development, or underlying themes, I enjoy breaking it all down and sharing my thoughts in a way that sparks conversations. I don’t just write reviews – I aim to bring a fresh perspective that makes readers think and feel. For me, every film is more than just a story – it’s an experience worth understanding.</p>

<p>At the same time, I’m deeply involved in the world of website development. I specialize in full-stack web development, with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
Python (Django/Flask), and modern frameworks like React.js. I’ve built and managed websites for startups and personal projects, including a few film review blogs and comparison pages that attract viewers looking for insightful and user-friendly experiences.</p>

<p>Combining my two passions, I created my own platform to post honest, relatable, and engaging movie reviews, while constantly improving the site’s UX/UI and performance. This blend of creativity and logic keeps me excited every day – I get to tell stories through my reviews and code at the same time.</p>
